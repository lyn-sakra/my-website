    <h1>Celebrating 6 Months of Love 💫</h1>
<p>
Every story has a beginning.  
Ours began with sunshine in BALI — and it’s only getting brighter & brighter.
<br><br>
Six months of love, laughter, growth, and holding on through every high and low.  
And now, with hearts full and so much still to look forward to…  
we’re finally just a few steps away from *us* — for real.
<br><br>
Here’s to the hugs that waited, the smiles that stayed, the lips that have gone unkissed, 
the Chiggy-Chiggy we desired, the coziness that we missed, the warmth long due, 
and all the celebrations we’ve saved up.  
We’ll make up for every missed moment — soon, together.  
1/2 year done and 1/2 more to go. ✨

  <section class="sky-section fly">
    <h1>I Believe I Can FLY 🕊️</h1>
    <p>Not only we will sing this together bacha but also we will make it happen.
    <br><br>
    We’ll soar together, chasing dreams, hitting milestones, and building a life that’s ours in every sense. Not just professionally but also personally — by showing up for each other, every single day. Growing 1% at a time — in our careers, in our hearts, in how we love, care, and become better for one another.
    <br><br>
    We’ll collect memories like souvenirs — from the places we will explore, the things we will try, adding new adventures and experiences like our BALI trip. And when life gets heavy, we’ll lift each other. When one forgets how to fly, the other will remind them how.
    <br><br>
    Because we’re not just building a future — we’re building each other. With kindness, with patience, with laughter, and with that steady kind of love that doesn’t fade away.
    <br><br>
    And soon, we’ll begin the next chapter — no more distance, no more screens. Just us, together — where we’ve always belonged.

  <section class="sky-section storm">
    <h1>We weathered the STORM too🌩️</h1>
<p>
We've had our share of difficult nights too full of misunderstandings, heated moments, and a few tough days. But through it all, we’ve remained side by side, stronger and more grounded. There were no moments of doubt, only questions that needed answers, and times we just wanted reassurance and maybe HUGs. And yet, here we are—still standing, still growing.
<br><br>
There were no second thoughts, no reconsiderations, no doubts —just two people holding on with love and commitment. There willl be fights, as you say, add that spark, that ‘masala’ to what we share. But more than anything, we choose to fight for <b>"US"</b> —for what we have and what we’re building together.
Let us not fight <b>"WITH"</b> each other (for sure we will - I cannot deny you that privilige that fun ) but let us fight <b>"FOR"</b> each other. 
<br><br>
Moving forward, we’ll remember not to let anger or hurt justify words or actions that can leave scars or damages like STORM. Instead, we’ll remind ourselves to stand beside each other—no matter the storm. Because no cloud, no matter how dark, can dim the light we’ve created together.

    <h1>Happy Anniversary my Love.</h1>
    <p>
      Let us celebrate this milestone, completing 6 months together and let us keep on moving forward 
      together. 
      From here on, the path ahead is beautifully uncertain - but it is on us, to shape, 
      to fill with new memories, kindness and love.
      So let us move to next chapter with tons of love and respect, holding hands and guiding each other.<br>
      The night may be long, but it's ours — and it's beautiful.

      Also, something is hidden in this website - just a click away all you have to do is find it.
      <br>
      If you can find it, your gift awaits.
      If not then do not blame me. I can only say that you would love it. Now show your <b>Sherlock Holmes</b> skills.

          <p>Yayyyy !! You Sherlock Holmes  !!! 
            Remember how you casually mentioned my <b>DIOR POISON is almost finished?</b>
So here is your gift Chang Mang.<br>
It’s here — almost LoL. It’s in India, just not with me yet.
I had asked my friend to bring it from USA, and if he visits Bangalore, he’ll bring it along.
If not, I’ll have it shipped to me — so do not worry.
<br>
That’s why I told you not to pack your perfume the other day 😉
<br>
I’ll keep you posted before your visit to INDIA, just to be safe.
But yeah… I just wanted you to know —
I’m listening, always.
Even to the tiniest things you say.
